## 1.3.1 | 2022.10.22

* Change lodash import to specific function, shrink vendor chunk

## 1.3.0 | 2022.10.14

### New features:

* Renamed DateTime service to LegacyDateTime and introduced new DateTime service which uses dayjs library instead of moment. LegacyDateTime is bound by default while new DateTime service can be accessed by using a tagged binding.
* Removed DateTime default binding

### Migration guide:

* Bind DateTime or LegacyDateTime in `config/services.ts`
E.g.
```ts
// based on dayjs
bind<IDateTime>(DateTimeType).to(DateTime).inSingletonScope()

// based on moment (legacy)
bind<ILegacyDateTime>(DateTimeType).to(LegacyDateTime).inSingletonScope()
```
